# Hangman



# Description:
This project is a hangman game implemented in C# using Windows Forms. The game allows users to guess a word or phrase and displays a set of empty labels that represent the letters of the word or phrase. Users can input their guesses, and the game will display the guessed letters (correct as well as incorrect) in the order they were guessed. The game will keep track of the number of games won and lost in the session.
